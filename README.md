# My Resume Writer

**My Resume Writer** is a web application that helps you write, modify and customize your resume for that perfect job application. You can store multiple versions of your resume and easily customize each one by including or excluding specific information with ease. I designed the app with reusability in mind, creating a tool that stays with you and grows alongside your long career journey.
